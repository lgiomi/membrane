# This file contains the details for the simulation of the antimixing.
#
# Each line consists of 5 numbers and contains: 
# the list of fixed temperature and J, the coupling value (it will be used in 9 different combinations),
# the number of iterations from 0 to 1 of the total average concentration, and the number of runs per point.
#
# The structure is as follows:
# Temperature 	Quadratic hom.	Coupling 	DeltaPhi	RunsPerPoint
# T 		J 		c 		NPhi 		rpp
