# This file contains the details for the simulation.
#
# It consists of three lines where we specify first the start, end and the steps for the total concentration, with the format:
# Concentration:
# c0_i	c0_f	n_c0	rpp (runs per point)
.01	.99	40	1
# Bending rigidtities:
# k_i	k_f	n_k  
.3	.3	0
# Gaussian splay:
# kb_i	kb_f	n_kb  
-0.3	-0.3	1
