# This file contains the details for the simulation.
#
# It consists of three lines where we specify first the start, end and the steps for the total concentration, with the format:
# Concentration:
# c0_i	c0_f	n_c0	rpp (runs per point)
.5	.5	1	10
# Bending rigidtities:
# k_i	k_f	n_k  
0	1	20
# Gaussian splay:
# kb_i	kb_f	n_kb  
-1	-1	40
