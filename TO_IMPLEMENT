TO DO:

	7- Explain the equipartition theorem, and also why it seems that (numerically) it is violated when the coupling with H^2 is switched on [CHECK THE 2017 MATH PAPER]

	13- RKF45 is not really implemented: we accept always the step, just reduce the next DT: does this create convergence problems?
		a. Is it possible to improve convergence?

	14- Fluctuations in the mixed phase: how are they linked to Laplace modes? 

	16- Proof of the fact that thermodynamical fluctuations of interface are negligible

	17- (Configurational) entropy considerations if we care only on number of domains (integrating degeneracies over phase space)
		a - MIXING ENTROPY S = phi log phi + (1-phi) log (1-phi) + J phi (1-phi) + CURVATURETERM

	20- Circular domain formation on developable surfaces: are they ever stable?

	22- Compute structure factor [a.k.a. the square of fourier modes of the solution in the mixed phase]

	24- What happens in the limit \sigma \to 0 ? (J \approx 0 in Durham guys paper)

	26I- Periodic BC

	26II - Surfaces with boundaries and Neumann conditions
		a- Open developable surfaces
		b- The gaussian bump
		c- Plumber's nightmare and other minimal
		d- Nodoids and other CMC surfaces

[UNDONE]28- Improve mesh reading with a strncp and just checking $Nodes and $Elements at random position 

	30- Construct a rotational ellipsoid, very oblate, and try to see the exceptional geodesics https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesics_on_an_ellipsoid fig 11&12, they should be preferred over CGC? maybe not.

	35- Rethinking the choice of potentials: can the shift of minima positions be a phsyically meaningful operation? Especially in account of the partially demixed phases observed by Melissa 
		a- Do simulations of the above point 

	36- Entropic considerations (in the paper on plumbers nightmare, they derive from F=U-TS a Fermi-Dirac distribution for the lipid density?). What is the meaning of entropy in this context 

	37- Check ref [3] of Jiang PRL. They see experimentally concentration shifts

	40- STABILITY of initial condition in the presence of U: use phi=c0 as initial conditions and see if you can infer whether spinodal deco will happen or just adiabatic rearrangment.

	41- Choose phi_1 and phi_2 arbitrarily when selecting -p initial conditon

	42- Implement Cahn-Hilliard

SIMULATIONS:

	1. Sphere
		a. with substrate
		b. in suspension
		c. without lagrange multiplier (check difference wrt a))

	2. Symmetric dumbbell
		a. with substrate
		b. in suspension
		c. without lagrange multiplier (check difference wrt a))
		
		(comment: experiments see always 3 domains when there is a substrate, while almost always 2 in suspension)

	3. Asymmetric dumbbell (radii ratio: 1:2)
		a. with substrate
		b. in suspension
		c. without lagrange multiplier (check difference wrt a))
